Custom Methods
==============

While we provide a number of data-based methods out of the box, you may find that you wish to implement a data-based predictor importance method which we have not provided. For convenience, we provide tools that may assist in the process of implementing those methods.

Firstly, we provide the function :ref:`abstract_variable_importance <abstract_variable_importance>`, which encapsulates the general process of performing a data-based predictor importance method and additionally provides automatic hooks into both the single- and multi-process backends. So long as the method which you wish to implement follows the general structure of "scoring" given ``(training_data, scoring_data)`` tuples to evaluate importance for each predictor in succession, you should be able to use the :ref:`abstract_variable_importance <abstract_variable_importance>` function directly by only providing a valid :ref:`selection_strategy <selection_strategy>`. For more on this process, so below. Even if your desired method does not match this pattern, you may still find utility in the two backends in :mod:`PermutationImportance.abstract_runner`.


Abstract Variable Importance
----------------------------

The :ref:`abstract_variable_importance <abstract_variable_importance>` function handles the generalized process for computing predictor importance. The algorithm itself consists of a double-``for`` loop, the first of which loops once for each of the predictors, the second of which loops over the list of triples ``(predictor, training_data, scoring_data)`` returned by the given :ref:`selection_strategy <selection_strategy>`. This allows for the majority of the implementation details to be left to the :ref:`selection_strategy <selection_strategy>`.

Selection Strategy
------------------

The :ref:`selection strategy <selection_strategy>` is the most important part of a predictor importance method, as it essentially defines the method. Here, a ``SelectionStrategy`` is an object which is initialized with the original ``training_data`` and ``scoring_data`` datasets passed to the predictor importance method, the total number of variables, and the current variables which are considered important. It must act as a generator which yields tuples of ``(variable, training_data_subset, scoring_data_subset)``. This can be thought of as yielding the information to test the importance of this ``variable`` by using the ``training_data_subset`` and ``scoring_data_subset``.

For convenience, we provide the base ``SelectionStrategy`` object, which should be extended to make a new method. Each object should have a static ``name`` property (for diagnostics) and should override the ``generate_all_datasets`` or ``generate_datasets`` method. As many methods test precisely the predictors which are not yet considered important, the default implementation of ``generate_all_datasets`` calls ``generate_datasets`` once for each currently unimportant predictor. Please see the implementation of the base :ref:`SelectionStrategy <selection_strategy>` object, as well as the other classes in :mod:`PermutationImportance.selection_strategies` for more details.
